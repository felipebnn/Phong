# Ray Trace Renderer (name TBD)
This is a work in progress, but still functional, ray trace renderer. It's scenes are composed of a text file that loads a single .obj model, sets it's position, color and size as well as lights with color and position.

The scenes are composed of a text file containing:
- Output image size
- Model name
- Positioning of said model
- Color material for the whole model
- Camera positioning
- Lights with coordinate and color

To be done:
- Add support for more than one model
- Add material information for each triangle
